This paper introduces a method for constructing a reservoir architectural parameter database (RAPDB) based on literature data extraction. It establishes a unified classification and grading system as well as a standardized data structure for the Braided River reservoir, and conducts statistical analysis on the quantitative data of different architectural units within the database.
